# Fitness-App-Data-Analysis-Case-Study-Using-Power-BI-SQL-and-Python
This project conducts an extensive analysis of user activity, sleep, and physiological data collected from the Strava fitness app. The analysis combines SQL-based data preprocessing with Python-driven insights and visualization, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard for KPI tracking and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key features of this project include:

-Data extraction, cleaning, and verification using MySQL Workbench

-Importing large datasets into Python for further analysis and aggregation

-Standardizing date and datetime formats for accurate temporal analysis

-Merging and summarizing data to identify weekly and monthly activity trends

-Conducting correlation analyses to explore relationships between activity, sleep, METs, and heart rate

-Developing visualizations such as heatmaps, trend graphs, and KPI dashboards in Power BI

-Providing actionable insights to enhance user engagement, lifestyle motivation, and feature development

This integrated approach facilitates data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for improving user experience and app performance.
